## Contributing

We try to do all styling via the css variables that are exposed by docsify-themeable, their [documentation](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/docsify-themeable/#/customization) lists the available options.

If it's not possible to do something with the vars then we write css, this should be kept to a minimum.
